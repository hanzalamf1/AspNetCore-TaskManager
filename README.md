# Task Manager - Comprehensive Task Management and Workflow System

## üìã Project Overview and System Architecture

Task Manager is a user-friendly and high-performance task management system developed using the most current versions of modern web technologies. This system is designed to serve a wide range of users from individual users to corporate organizations, providing comprehensive solutions for organizing, tracking, managing, and analyzing tasks. The system integrates advanced admin panel features along with user management, task tracking, statistical analysis, and reporting capabilities in a unified manner.

### üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack and Architectural Structure

#### Backend Architecture (ASP.NET Core 9.0)
The backend layer of the system is built on Microsoft's most current framework, ASP.NET Core 9.0, which is optimized to meet the requirements of modern web applications. SQL Server is used in the database layer to provide a reliable and scalable data storage solution. This structure, used together with Entity Framework Core, enables fast and secure execution of database operations. The authentication system is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Token) Bearer Token technology, providing a secure and stateless authentication mechanism. Swagger/OpenAPI integration is used for API documentation, allowing developers to easily test API endpoints and access documentation. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support enables secure processing of requests from different domains.

#### Frontend Technologies and User Experience
Modern web standards-compliant HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript technologies are used in the frontend layer, with various libraries and frameworks integrated to maintain the highest level of user experience. Bootstrap 5.3.2 is used to implement responsive design principles and provide optimal viewing experience on different devices. Font Awesome 6.4.2 library is used to provide a rich icon set, enhancing visual richness. Select2 library is integrated to provide advanced dropdown components and improve user interactions. Inter Font is used to provide modern and readable typography.

## üöÄ System Operation and Core Features

### Authentication and Authorization Mechanism
The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication, which is a secure and modern authentication mechanism. With this system, users can securely log into the system and session information is managed through tokens. After users successfully log in, tokens generated by the system are securely stored in localStorage and automatically sent in the Authorization header with every API request. This approach provides a stateless authentication mechanism, improving system performance and eliminating the need to store session information on the server side.

### Comprehensive Task Management System
The system provides a comprehensive task management module for users to effectively manage their tasks. Users can easily perform task creation, editing, deletion, and tracking operations. Tasks are categorized according to work priorities and managed with three different priority levels: low, medium, and high. Automatic overdue checking is performed for tasks with determined end dates, and overdue tasks are visually marked. With the approval system, tasks can be approved or rejected by admin users. This feature facilitates control of task workflows and quality assurance in corporate environments.

### Dynamic Remaining Days System
The system has implemented an advanced remaining days system to track users' account durations. Each user creates an account with a 30-day initial period when registering to the system. The DailyRemainingDaysService, a background service, automatically runs every day at 00:05, reducing all active users' remaining days by one. This service is implemented securely using the dependency injection pattern and runs in the background without affecting system performance. Users can view their remaining days on the dashboard, and duration extensions can be made by admin users when necessary.

### Advanced Admin Panel and Management Features
Admin users can manage all components of the system through a centralized panel. This panel includes different modules such as user management, task tracking, product management, order processing, and communication messages. Admin users can view, edit, and perform account operations for all users when necessary. With the task management module, they can view all tasks and perform approval or rejection operations. With the communication messages module, they can track and respond to messages from users. The system provides detailed statistics and reports to admin users, enabling them to analyze system performance and user activities.

## üì¶ Integrated NuGet Packages and Technology Dependencies

Various NuGet packages are integrated to provide the best practices in terms of security, performance, and user experience. The BCrypt.Net-Next package provides a secure and modern algorithm for password hashing operations. This package enables secure storage of user passwords and protection against brute force attacks. The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer package enables the implementation of JWT-based authentication system and provides secure token management. The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization package facilitates the establishment of the authorization system and management of user roles. The Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi package provides API documentation and test interface, enabling developers to easily test API endpoints. The Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design package facilitates the management of Entity Framework Core migrations and updating of database schema. The Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer package provides integration with SQL Server database and offers performant data access. The Swashbuckle.AspNetCore package provides Swagger UI interface, presenting API documentation visually.

## üîß Program.cs Configuration and Middleware Pipeline Analysis

The Program.cs file serves as the application's entry point and manages all service configurations, middleware pipeline, and application lifecycle. This file uses the minimal API approach of modern ASP.NET Core applications, providing more functionality with less code. During the service configuration phase, JSON serialization settings are optimized and necessary configurations are made to prevent circular reference issues. Swagger integration is added to provide API documentation and test interface, enabling developers to easily test API endpoints. Database connection is configured using Entity Framework Core and integration with SQL Server database is provided. DailyRemainingDaysService is registered as a background service and necessary infrastructure is prepared for automatic reduction of users' remaining days. CORS policy is configured for secure processing of requests from different domains and all origins, headers, and methods are allowed. JWT authentication system is configured with necessary parameters for secure token management, and issuer, audience, lifetime, and signing key validations are activated.

### Middleware Pipeline and Processing Order
The middleware pipeline consists of components that run during HTTP request processing and handle each request at different stages. This pipeline is optimized to ensure requests are processed securely, efficiently, and correctly. Exception handling middleware catches errors that may occur throughout the application and provides user-friendly error messages. HTTPS redirection middleware automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS for security and provides secure communication. Static files middleware serves static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) from the wwwroot folder and provides performant file access. Routing middleware directs URLs to controller actions and supports RESTful API structure. CORS middleware processes cross-origin requests and ensures secure processing of requests from different domains. Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens and checks user credentials. Authorization middleware checks user roles and manages access permissions. Controllers middleware processes API endpoints and directs HTTP requests to appropriate controller actions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è DailyRemainingDaysService and Background Service Architecture

DailyRemainingDaysService is designed as one of the critical components of the system and is an advanced background service that provides automatic management of users' account durations. This service is implemented using ASP.NET Core's hosted service pattern and runs continuously in the background throughout the application lifecycle. The service creates a scope securely from the dependency injection container to perform database operations and disposes the scope after each operation to prevent memory leaks.

### Scheduled Operation Mechanism and Performance Optimization
The service is configured to run automatically every day at 00:05 and runs in the background without affecting system performance. The scheduling algorithm calculates the next run time to efficiently use system resources. The service only processes users with remaining days greater than zero and optimizes performance by preventing unnecessary database operations. CancellationToken is used to enable safe stopping of the service and ensure proper cleanup of resources when the application is shut down.

### Security and Error Management Features
The service is equipped with exception handling mechanism, catching potential errors and recording error details with the logging system. Using the dependency injection pattern, the service's testability is increased and writing unit tests is facilitated. Database operations are performed within transaction scope and data consistency is guaranteed. The service uses async/await pattern to efficiently use system resources and prevent thread blocking.

## üöÄ LaunchSettings.json and Application Configuration

The LaunchSettings.json file contains runtime configurations and development environment settings of the ASP.NET Core application. This file is used by Visual Studio and dotnet CLI to determine how the application will be started and with what settings it will run. The file is written in JSON format and configured according to Microsoft's standard launch settings schema. This configuration enables developers to run the application in different environments (development, staging, production) and define special settings for each environment.

### Port Configuration and Security Settings
The system is configured to support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, with HTTP port set to 5078 and HTTPS port set to 7187. This dual port configuration enables fast testing of HTTP during development while enabling HTTPS to provide secure communication in production environment. Launch browser feature is activated, and when the application is started, the default web browser opens automatically and redirects to the index.html page. In the environment variables section, ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT variable is set to Development, which activates development environment-specific configurations (error details, debug information, Swagger UI).

### Development Environment Optimizations
Dotnet run messages feature is activated, which displays detailed log messages when the application is started and allows developers to get instant information about application status. Command name is set to Project, which means the application runs directly from the project file and faster startup times are obtained. Launch URL setting is configured as index.html, which means when the application is started, direct redirection to the main page is performed. This configuration improves user experience and prevents unnecessary redirects.
